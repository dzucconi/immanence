> That is, my architectural body has not assembled enough clues to connect itself properly to its surroundings.
> Sites of reversible destiny are designed to be as complex as our most innate mechanisms of our perception.
> It might take an hour to go from one room to another, and I might live there in a continual state of deja vu as I experience a repetition of slightly differing perceptions.
> Yet, I will be involved in a constant critique of my own experience.
> I will see.
> I will live.
