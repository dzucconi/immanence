That is, my architectural body has not assembled enough clues to connect itself properly to its surroundings. Sites of reversible destiny are designed to be as complex as our most innate mechanisms of our perception. It might take an hour to go from one room to another, and I might live there in a continual state of deja vu as I experience a repetition of slightly differing perceptions. Yet, I will be involved in a constant critique of my own experience. I will see. I will live. Perhaps for the first time. â€”Arakawa and Gins
